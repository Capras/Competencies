### 1. FRONT END DEVELOPMENT HTML & CSS

---

##### Personal proof of concept for HTML & CSS Including Bootstrap:
A simple, responsive website from July 2017 that uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Basic Business Website - hosted](https://krystin987.github.io/maggie/) | [code repository](https://github.com/krystin987/maggie)  

This basic outline for creating a simple 'first web app' boilerplate was developed in January 2018 for incoming apprentices. It briefly describes the three basic file components (html, css, javascript) and how to write them to see immediate results in a browser.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Basic Webapp boilerplate repository](https://github.com/krystin987/Boilerplate)

In the past 90 days over 20 hours were spent in the academy mentoring or reviewing code with apprentices in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

---

##### Code Formatting

- [ ] While going through code, check the code formatting to improve readability and ensure there are no blockers

##### Architecture

- [ ] Separation of Concerns followed


- [ ] Split into respective files (HTML, JavaScript and CSS)


- [ ] Split into multiple layers and tiers as per requirements (Presentation, Business, and Data Layers)


- [ ] Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies


- [ ] Design patterns: Use appropriate design pattern (if if helps), after completely understanding the problem and context

##### Coding Best Practices

- [ ] No hard coding, use constants/configuration values


- [ ] Group similar values under an enumeration (enum)


- [ ] Comments - Do not write comments for what you are doing, instead write comments on why you are doing. Specify about any hacks workaround and temporary fixes. Additionally mention pending tasks in your to-do comments, which can be tracked easily


- [ ] Avoid multiple if/else blocks


- [ ] Use framework features, wherever possible instead of writing custom code

##### Non Functional Requirements

- [ ] a.) Maintainability (Supportability) - The application should require the least amount of effort to support in the near future. It should be easy to identify, fix, and detect.

      ​	Readability: Code should be self-explanatory. Get a feel of story reading. while going through code. Use appropriate name for variables, functions and classes. If you are taking more time to understand  the code, then either code needs refactoring or at least comments have to be written to make it clear.

      ​	Testability: The code should be easy to test. Refactor into separate function (if required). Use interfaces while talking to other layers, as interfaces can be mocked easily. Try to avoid static functions, singleton classes as these are not easily testable by mocks.

      ​	Debug-ability: Provide support to log the flow of control, parameter data and exception details to find the root cause easily. if you are using Log4Net like component then add support for database logging also as querying the log table is easy.

      ​	Configurability: Keep the configurable values in place (XML file, database table) so that no code changes are required, if the data is changed frequently.


- [ ] b.) Reusability

      ​	DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle: The same code should not be repeated more than twice

      ​	Consider reusable services, functions and components

      ​	Consider generic functions and classes


- [ ] c.) Reliability - Exception handling and cleanup (dispose) resources.



- [ ] d.) Extensibility - Easy to add enhancements with minimal changes to existing code. One component should be easily replaceable by a better component.



- [ ] e.) Security - Authentication, authorization, input data validation against security threats such as SQL injections and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), encrypting the sensitive data (passwords, credit card information etc.)



- [ ] f.) Performance

      Use a data type that best suits the needs such as StringBuilder, generic collection classes

      Lazy loading asynchronous and parallel processing

      Caching and session/application data

- [ ] g.) Scalability - Consider if it supports a large user base/data? Can this be deployed into web farms?



- [ ] h.) Usability - Put yourself in the shoes of a end-user and ascertain, if the user interface/API is easy to understand and use. If you are not convinced with the user interface design, then start discussing your ideas with the business analyst


##### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Principles

- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle (SRS): Do not place more than one responsibility into a single class of function, refactor into separate classes and functions


- [ ] Open Closed Principle: While adding new functionality, existing code should not be modified. New functionality should be written in new classes and functions


- [ ] Liskov substitutability principle: The child class should not change the behavior (meaning) of the parent class. The child class can be used as a substitute for a base class.
      - Completed Interface Polygons class


- [ ] Interface segregation: Do not create lengthy interfaces, instead split them into smaller interfaces based on the functionality. The interface should not contain any dependencies (parameters), which are not require for the expected functionality


- [ ] Dependency Injection: Do not hardcode the dependencies, instead inject them
